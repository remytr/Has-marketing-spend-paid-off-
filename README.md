# Has-marketing-spend-paid-off-
Increase in marketing spend and there needs to be justification for this. 

## Objective
FP& analysts flagged a sharp increase in marketing spend. Analysed metrics to see if the marketing spend has paid off.

## Analysis
1. Looked at LTV. New customers have a high LTV but don't stay beyond a quarter. Recommendation to bring back a loyalty scheme. This would increase the North Star Metric by incentivising repeat purchases.
2. Acquisition should not be the only focus for the company. Recommend splitting marketing efforts between acquisition and customer retention. An increase in retention rate by 5% would increase profit by 25% according to research.
3. Marketing efforts should be directed towards Google channels, mainly CPC and organic. This would lead to continued revenue performance.
